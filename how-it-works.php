			<h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p class="albin">If you like the idea of earning an extra or even a full time income, you're welcome to take advantage of our PowerOf5 Scheme. <br><br>
You are welcome to take advantage of our Matchless and Highly Lucrative Compensation Plan. <br><br>
To participate in this, a onetime entry payment of N1,200 or N6,000 is required, and you will be given a mathematics hand booklet with a video cd that contain an explanation of the mathematics hand booklet. Members earn in every 7 different stages and they progress from stage to stage they earn.  <br><br>
Members can refer as many new members as they can, doing this, they earn more money on anyone who signs up another with his referral link, and it also help to cause a faster spill over in their network.
